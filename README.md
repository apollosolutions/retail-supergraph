# Apollo GraphOS for Retail

This repo provides a demonstration supergraph for a retail business containing checkout, discovery, inventory, orders, products, reviews, shipping, and users subgraphs. You can explore the schema and run queries against it in Apollo Studio. We encourage you to also use the schema as inspiration for your own retail supergraph!

## View the Schema

This demo is published to the [Apollo Solutions organization](https://studio.apollographql.com/org/apollo-solutions) in Apollo Studio with the graph ID [apollo-retail-supergraph](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/apollo-retail-supergraph).

You can also view and share the [public variant](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-retail-supergraph/home?variant=prod) to run queries right from Explorer.

## What's Inside

If you would like to run some sample operations, checkout the public [Operation Collections](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-retail-supergraph/explorer?collectionId=9da0ba4b-12d1-4ebb-89bb-bed4a4d476ff&focusCollectionId=9da0ba4b-12d1-4ebb-89bb-bed4a4d476ff&variant=prod) in Explorer.

We also have a series of blog posts on retail best practices that dive into different elements of this schema to illustrate how Apollo GraphOS helps power essential features of modern retail applications:
